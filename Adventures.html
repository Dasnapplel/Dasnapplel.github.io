      <h1>Cycling</h1>
      <p>Me, my dad, and my brother are all Dutch. Perhaps it's in our blood to cycle. 
        Here are the major adventures that I've done on the bike.</p>
      <div class="section-content">

            <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grand Rapids to Mackinaw City</span><br><span style="font-size: medium;">(August 4-12, 2018)</span></h3>
            <p>My dad has always been a cycler and adventurer. In his past, he's cycled around all of South America, 
            and on a motorbike he traveled from the Netherlands to Australia. I guess he wanted to let me experience a taste of that same type of adventure, 
            so at some point, we decided to cycle across all of Michigan together. We planned on heading to Mackinaw City, 
            because then we could head to Mackinac Island and have a sort of victory lap around the island! 
            In the end, this trip took five days, and we traveled around 240 miles total. I was 12 years old.</p>

            <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grand Rapids to Grand Traverse Lighthouse</span><br><span style="font-size: medium;">(August 14-19, 2022)</span></h3>
            <p>After a few years, my brother became 14 and he and my dad both wanted to do a cycling trip together as well. 
            My brother decided to set the destination as Great Wolf Lodge for fun, and they set off. I wanted to have fun too though, 
            so in the end, my dad decided to make two trips, one with my brother to Traverse City, and one with me. I decided to set my destination as 
            the Grand Traverse Lighthouse, because it was located at what could be looked at as the 'pinky' of Michigan. 
            This way I could say that I cycled to the 'middle' and 'pinky' fingers of the state. 
            In the end, this trip took four days, and we traveled around 180 miles. I was 16 years old.</p>

            <p>To do long distance cycling trips, some training and preparation is definitely required. To practice experiencing a day of cycling,
            my dad and I decided to cycle from Lowell county to Pewamo county. We took the Fred Meijer Grand River Valley Trail, and traveled about 50 miles.
            We also saw a cool museum about the trains that used to travel on the trail a long time ago!</p>

      <p>Throughout the years, I've been on some really fun adventures by car. Here are a few of them.</p>

            <p>When I got tickets to go to a J-Pop concert in Chicago, I originally intended to go with one of my best friends for only a day. 
              My brother, however, wanted to go with me instead because he actually liked the singer, unlike my friend. 
              I was okay with him coming along, but my friend was my ride to Chicago, so I had to find a way to get transport. 
              Since the concert was on a Thursday evening, I ended up convincing my parents to take a four day weekend roadtrip. 
              We ended up going to Milwaukee Wisconsin for the majority of the trip, and spent our time at a variety of museums including the Milwaukee Art Museum, 
              National Bobblehead Museum, Volo Auto Museum and Jurassic Gardens, and the Harley-Davidson Museum. It was fun!</p>

            <p>After graduating high school, me and two other friends decided to do a road trip together for fun. Since elementary school,
              there's been a place that's been nearly foreshadowed as a vacation spot that we would take, and that was the Mall of America.
              Since we were all somewhat introverted nerds, we joked that we postponed the stereotypical teenager-mall-hang-out to the end,
              and that we prioritized quality over quantity. It was fun!</p>

            <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michigan Tech</span><br><span style="font-size: medium;">(January 11-16, 2024)</span></h3>
            <p>Back when I was applying for colleges, Michigan Tech was one of the top contenders. Because of this, I applied for a few scholarships that they had.
              One of them was the 'Leading Scholar Award', where I had to write an essay that revolved around my leadership related experience.
              I ended up writing an essay about how I use internet memes to connect with people and make them laugh, and was a winner!
              My mom and I flew to Houghton, Michigan at first, for what was supposed to be a weekend event and tour at Michigan Tech.
              However, there was a terrible blizzard that kept us stuck in Houghton for an extra three days. In the end,
              my mom and I decided to rent a car and drive the eight hours from Houghton to Grand Rapids. It was very beautiful driving through the upper peninsula
              and Mackinaw Bridge in the winter!</p>

            <p>After I finished my first cycling trip to Mackinaw with my dad, my family went on vacation together. My parents had wanted to travel 
              to Washington DC for some time, since they're foreigners and wanted to see the capital. 
              They also found several interesting things to do in Virginia, like Massanutten Resort, Luray Caverns, and Monticello. 
              In the end, we had a road trip traveling to each of these locations. It was fun!</p>

              We first flew to Mexico City where our family lives to say hi, and then we went to our resort in Cancun. 
              Over the course of our vacation, we went to several different attractions like Xcaret, Xenses, and Chichen Itza. It was fun!</p>

            <p>My family had been planning on traveling to Japan for years before we finally went.
              My mom wanted to go back in 2020, but then the pandemic happened, and we put the plan on the sideline for a while.
              After I graduated high school, I put the idea up in the air again, and we all agreed that it was the perfect time to go.
              I had just graduated, so it was like a reward for me. I had also been learning Japanese in my free time as a hobby, so I was trained enough to help out if needed.
              Additionally, the economy at the time had a good dollar to yen conversion rate. We traveled to all different types of temples, museums, theme parks, restaurants, and parks.
              I designed and scheduled the entire itinerary, and my family agreed that it was the best vacation that we had ever had!</p>

              The cruise we took traveled from Italy to Greece, Turkey and back. Notable places we visited were Venice, and Mykonos.
              I believe Mykonos in particular was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen. It was fun!</p>

              Since the next closest one was in Miami, we decided to make the trip worthwhile and turned it into a vacation!

            <p>I’ve always lived with my family. There hasn’t been a time in my life where I was separated from them for more than a week, and now that I’m an adult, I wanted to leave for a while just to prove that I can. 
              I’m a student commuter at Grand Valley State University too, which means I didn’t have the instant friendship that comes from living on campus together with others. 
              It’s difficult making friends at today’s colleges. I’ve also always wanted to do a study abroad program just for the thrill of it, so to answer all of these feelings, 
              I ended up signing up for the only faculty-led one that Grand Valley had to offer. It was mainly located in Winterthur, and was one of the best decisions I’ve made in college so far. 
              I became friends with people on campus and from another nation, I got to fully experience another nation in their daily life, and I got to learn and create incredible things way cooler than I thought I was capable of doing at this point. 
              I went to Ebenalp, Rhine Falls, Bern, Zurich, witnessed a graduation ceremony for ZHAW, and hiked to Schloss Kyburg, and so much more! It was worth every penny!</p>
